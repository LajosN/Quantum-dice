# Quantum-dice
Quantum-dice is a truly random generator take advantage of superposition of qubits. When a qubit is in superposition it represents two state 1 and 0 at the same time. When observation happens it collapse into a single 1 or 0 bit so it is truly random. Quantum dice operates on a quantum computer which is accessible for anyone from the cloud.
